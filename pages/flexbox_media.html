              <h3 class="media-heading">Kerala</h3>
              <p>“If Kerala is God’s own country, the Alleppey is its best paradise.
                   Much famed to be an ultimate spot for honeymooners and couples,
                    Alleppey has a lot more than what meets the eye which makes it
                     one of the best family holiday destinations in India as well.
                      While cruising the backwaters, and a houseboat stay are considered
                       to be the things to do in Alleppey, there are a lot more fascinating things like boat racing,
                   witnessing a Kathakali show, and more, which are a delight to all types of travelers.”
